Temperature Converter
---------------------

Well, ok, it's just Fahrenheit to Celsius, but it still converts temperatures at least one way!

To get started:

1. Open qunit.html and see what tests are failing and what tests are passing.
2. Open js/converter.js and fill in the details.
3. Once you implement some code, open up qunit.html and see if all the tests are passing.
4. After all the tests pass, commit the code to the repository.
